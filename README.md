# Swap Stubs

this plugin swaps the electrical connection between two pins. It swaps the labels in the schematics and ratsnest in layout to keep the project in sync.

As plugin modifies schematic files it closes the schematic editor. The plugin creates a lot of whitespace changes in schematics file.
